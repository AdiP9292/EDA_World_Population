# EDA on World Population
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project focused on the World Population Dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to uncover insights, patterns, and trends in global population growth using Python's data analysis and visualization libraries.


## Dataset Overview

The dataset provides a comprehensive snapshot of world population statistics across countries and regions. It includes various demographic and development metrics, allowing for comparative analysis and visualization.


**Source:** Kaggle – World Population Dataset

**Key Features**
- **Country:** Name of the country or territory

- **Continent:** Continent the country belongs to

- **2022 Population:** Estimated population in 2022

- **Growth Rate:** Annual growth rate

- **Area (km²):** Total area of the country

- **Density (per km²):** Population density

- **Urban Population% :** Percentage of the population living in urban areas

- **World Population Percentage:** Share of the world population


## Project Objectives

- Perform data cleaning (handle missing values, rename columns, check data types)

- Generate summary statistics for population metrics

- Visualize regional and global population trends

- Identify high-growth countries and regions

- Analyze urbanization patterns across continents

## Key Insights
Some of the key insights uncovered:

- Countries with the highest and lowest growth rates

- Urbanization trends across continents

- Top 10 most populous countries in 2022

- Correlation between population size, density, and area

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python (Google Colab)

- Pandas – Data manipulation

- Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

- NumPy – Numerical operations
